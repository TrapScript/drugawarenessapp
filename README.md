##Drug and Substance Awareness
This repository contains code for a web page focused on drug and substance abuse awareness. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The web page provides information about drug abuse, effects of commonly abused substances, and support for recovery.

##Getting Started
To view the web page, simply open the HTML file in a web browser of your choice. Ensure that all the associated files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) are located in the same directory.

##Features
The web page consists of the following sections:

Header: Displays the title "Drug and Substance abuse Awareness" and a navigation menu with links to different sections of the page.
Hero Section: Provides a brief introduction to the purpose of the web page, emphasizing the importance of educating individuals for a substance-free life.
Featured Section: Presents information about commonly abused drugs and substances. It includes a list of drugs and their effects, presented in separate cards.
Support for Recovery: Provides information on how to seek support and assistance for recovery from substance addiction.
Footer: Displays a copyright notice for the "Drug and substances abuse awareness 2023" campaign.

##Styling
The CSS file (script.css) is used to style the web page. It includes styling for various elements such as the header, navigation menu, sections, cards, and footer. The styling aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

##JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code included at the end of the HTML file demonstrates how to fetch data asynchronously from an API (https://api.example.com/drugs). It retrieves information about drugs and substances and dynamically populates the list of commonly abused drugs (#drugList) on the web page.

##API Interaction
The JavaScript code uses the Fetch API to make an asynchronous request to the specified API endpoint. The response is then parsed as JSON, and the drug data is iterated over to create list items dynamically. In case of any errors during the API request, an error message is logged to the console.

Please note that the API endpoint specified (https://api.example.com/drugs) is a placeholder. Replace it with the actual API endpoint that provides drug data in JSON format.
